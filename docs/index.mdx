# Apibara Python SDK

It's possible to implement Apibara applications using the Python SDK.

The Python SDK is great to develop applications that:

 - use ML and AI to process blockchain data,
 - interact with external http services,
 - leverage the vast ecosystem of Python packages.

## Installation

You can install the `apibara` package using pip:

```sh
python3 -m pip install apibara[indexer]
```

Alternatively, you can use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and add Apibara to the list of dependencies:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
apibara = { version = "^0.6.0", extras = ["indexer"] }
```

## Using a template

We provide a [template project](https://github.com/apibara/python-indexer-template) to get you started even quicker.

### From the GitHub interface

Click on the _"Use this template"_ button, then fill out the name and visibility of your new repository. Finally, clone the repository to your machine.

### From the GitHub cli

Create a new repository, starting from the provided template:

```sh
gh repo create my-indexer --clone --public --template https://github.com/apibara/python-indexer-template
```

This will create a new public repository in your GitHub account. The project is now ready in the `my-indexer` folder on your machine.

If you see a git-related error after creating the repository, `cd` into the new folder and run `git pull origin main`.
